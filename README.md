# Machine-Learning
Here are some notes and codes in the process of learning machine learning. 



Each chapter of Machine Learning is stored in a folder whose name starts with a number. In these folders: 

- Notes are available as markdwom documents.

    The images in the notes are saved in a folder with the same name as the notes.

- The code folder is used to store the code that implements the learning content.
