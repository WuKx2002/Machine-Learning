# Machine-Learning
Here are some notes and codes in the process of learning machine learning. 



Each chapter of Machine Learning is stored in a folder whose name starts with a number. In these folders: 

- Notes are available as markdwom documents.

    The images in the notes are saved in a folder with the same name as the notes.

- The code folder is used to store the code that implements the learning content.



I'm sorry to say that some of the formulas in the notes cannot be displayed online on the github page. Adding the [GitHub with MathJax](https://github.com/orsharir/github-mathjax) plugin to your browser may solve some of the problems but not all. So it is recommended that you download them locally and use a markdown viewer such as Typora to see them.
